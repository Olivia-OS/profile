While keeping in mind to design mobile view first,
I started to draw out the UI on a whiteboard, getting
a rough idea of what I wanted the site to look like.

Next, I draw the desired desktop view.

This is when i started to think about media queries:
the site need to be responsive. 
Its has to look good on a cellphone, tablet, and desktop.

After I knew what i want my site to look like on multiple devices,
I wrote down my Objectives and To-do Lists and started from there.

src code includes:

index.html
bio.html
blog.html
hobby.html
skills.html
cv.html

CSS stylesheets:

style.css
linked.css

Others:

images folder

and this README.md

Thank you!!!
